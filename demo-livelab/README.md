**Oracle NoSQL Database** is designed for today’s most demanding applications that 
require low latency responses, flexible data models, and elastic scaling for dynamic workloads. 
It supports JSON, Table and Key-Value datatypes running on-premise, or as a cloud 
service with on-demand throughput and storage based provisioning.

**Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service** is now a fully managed database service running 
on Gen 2 Oracle Cloud Infrastructure hardware.
